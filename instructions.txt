UAC Bypass:
Save as "UAC Bypass.reg" and simply open.
If the creation of this file is blocked, create a shortcut to C:/users/[YOUR USERNAME] and then make a new folder named anything, right click it, go down to properties, 
and then change it to hidden. Create the "UAC Bypass.reg" in there and open, it should now be unblocked. If for whatever reason you are doing this on a system that actually has
good security, head down to advanced instructions.

UAC Bypass:
Follow all previous steps for UAC Bypass, but this time, create a batch file named bypass.bat and within it type "cmd /min /C "set __COMPAT_LAYER=RUNASINVOKER && start "" %1"" 
Now drag the .reg file on to the .bat file. Now when right clicking objects, you should have an option that says "UAC Bypass" and upon using it, you will be able to run admin 
apps without being detected by UAC.
